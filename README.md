SimpleHL7
=========
Let's face it, HL7 is more of a recommendation than a standard. Every HIE interprets the HL7 
standard differently and exercises their creativity when building an interface. If HL7 was in 
fact as standard in practice as in theory, a lot of HL7 analysts would be without a job. Using
SimpleHL7, many HL7 analysts and developers can accomplish simple tasks easily] without a lot of 
overhead. 

Projects like HL7API are great, but in many scenarios as overkill the the task. This project is 
meant to supply a means to easily grab data elements out a message for routing, add segments so 
more useful information is available or replace values of existing data.
